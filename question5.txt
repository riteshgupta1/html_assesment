Question 5: Why do we use meta tags?

Solution: 

Meta tags are used in the <head> section of an HTML document to provide metadata about the webpage. 
Metadata is information about the page that isn't necessarily displayed to users but is used by browsers, search engines
, and other web services. These tags help optimize and improve the functionality of the webpage in a variety of ways.

  in other words we can say that it is data abut data . 

1. Search engine optimisation : 
         Meta tags can help search engines understand the content of your page. 
         For example:

          <meta name="description" content="this is discription of the page">
            it helps search engines display a snippet of the content when the page appears in search results.

2. Character Set Specification:
       <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the page.


3.Viewport Configuration:
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag is essential for responsive web design, and scale according to screen size.

4. Author and Copyright Information:
     <meta name="author" content="John Doe"> or <meta name="copyright" content="2025 Company Name"> provide information about the author or copyright details for the page.
