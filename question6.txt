Question : What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

 Solution: 
 In HTML, IDs and classes are both attributes used to assign identifiers to HTML elements.
  They help with styling and scripting, especially when using CSS or JavaScript to target specific elements on a webpage.

  id : 
  1. Unique--> An id should be unique within a page. It is used to identify a single element, meaning no two elements should share the same id value.

  2.Use in CSS:-->  You reference an id in CSS by prefixing it with a # symbol.

  3.Use in JavaScript: You can easily select an element by its id using document.getElementById().

  Example : 
  <div id="header">This is a header</div>


  in css file -->
#header {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}

in js file --> 
let header = document.getElementById('header');


class : 
1. Non-unique --> A class can be shared by multiple elements. 
This allows you to apply the same style or behavior to multiple elements at once.

2.Use in CSS: You reference a class in CSS by prefixing it with a . (dot) symbol.

3. Usage in JavaScript: You can select elements by their class using methods like document.getElementsByClassName().


  difference between id and class --->
               id                                            class
   Unique   to one element per page	              Can be applied to multiple elements
       Prefixed with # in CSS (#header)	           Prefixed with . in CSS (.section)
Purpose	Used for targeting a single element	       Used for targeting multiple elements
JavaScript	document.getElementById('id')	        document.getElementsByClassName('class')
